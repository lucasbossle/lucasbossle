# Lucas Bossle
Hello world! I'm a software developer based in Curitiba, Brazil.

I have 3 years of experience working with web applications, databases, REST APIs, messaging and other cool things.

I'm interested in learning more about serverless application architecture, CI/CD and improving my coding abilities.

My main language is Python, but I also know some Java and I'm learning Rust.

You can contact my via lbossle.dev@gmail.com.

I have an old account on GitHub from which I got locked out, so I had to create this one.
