# Lucas Bossle
Hello world! I'm a software developer based in Curitiba, Brazil.

I have 4 years of experience working with web applications, databases, REST APIs, AWS Lambda and API Gateway, messaging and other cool things.

I'm interested in learning more about serverless application architecture, CI/CD and improving my coding abilities.

My main language is Python, but I also know some Java and I'm learning Rust.

## Contact

You can contact my via lbossle.dev@gmail.com.

I have an old account on GitHub from which I got locked out (yes, it's possible - take good care of your credentials), so I had to create this one.

You can find my old stuff at https://github.com/lcsbossle
